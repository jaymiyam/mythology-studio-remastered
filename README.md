# Mythology Studio Landing Page version 2.0

This is an updated version of a landing page design & code practice project that I did a while back. [Version 1.0](https://github.com/jaymiyam/mythology-studio-landing-page) was created mainly for the purpose of practicing design and using GSAP. This version 2.0 is more complex and utilizes a new set of tools.
